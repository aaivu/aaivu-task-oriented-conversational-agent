## Summary

Implementing a task-oriented conversational agent in low resource settings addressing the overfitting issue arise when optimizing dialogue policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and utilizing pipeline ensembling in Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

## Description

we  introduce  a  comprehensive task-oriented conversational agent in low resource settings utilizing a novel pipeline ensemble technique to enhance natural language understanding and utilizing the Reinforcement Learning based  dialogue  policy  learner  by  proposing  a  novel  approach  for  synthetic  agenda  generation by acknowledging the underlying probability distribution of the user agendas with a reward-based  sampling  method  that  prioritizes  failed  dialogue  acts
